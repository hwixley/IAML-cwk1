Describe what the parameters represent for this 1D data. For this part, you should use the sklearn implementation of Linear Regression. Hint: By default in sklearn fit\137intercept = True. Instead, set fit\137intercept = False and pre-pend 1 to each value of xi yourself to create bold0mu mumu \(xi\) = [1, xi]. \040}{section.1}% 3

Report your code in the answer box. It should only take a few lines \(i.e. <5\). Hint: Only report the relevant lines for estimating w e.g. we do not need to see the data loading code.
